# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to create a summary dataframe that shows ride-sharing data by city type, along with a visual that shows the total weekly fares for each city type in order to summarize how the data differs by city type. This, in turn, will allow decision-makers at PyBer to use these differences to their advantage.
