# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to create a summary dataframe that shows ride-sharing data by city type, along with a visual that shows the total weekly fares for each city type in order to summarize how the data differs by city type. This, in turn, allows the results to be presented to decision-makers at PyBer in order to be used to their advantage.

## Summary
* One of my recommendations is to hire more drivers in rural cities in order to increase numbers from total rides to total fares and so on.
