# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to create a summary dataframe that shows ride-sharing data by city type, along with a visual that shows the total weekly fares for each city type in order to summarize how the data differs by city type. This, in turn, allows the results to be presented to decision-makers at PyBer in order to be used to their advantage.  
## Results
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
